CS456/CS556/MA456 Cryptography Assignment 3 (Fall 2016)
Submit this plaintext unencrypted by email along with all the ElGamal keys used for the encryption.
Write a simple socket-based chat program that uses ElGamal with DES/AES (your choice) in a programming 
language of your choice. Allow the user to specify the bit-length for the prime and the secret key for 
DES/AES. Implement a system that encrypts single ASCII characters. Arrange an online demonstration of 
your program. You may work in groups of three.
