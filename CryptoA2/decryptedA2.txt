This is assignment two for our cryptography course in Fall 2016.
In this assignment, write your own implementation of the RSA 
cryptographic system in any programming language of your choice.
But allow the user the freedom to choose their own bit-length for the
prime numbers. Your system should also encrypt only single ASCII characters 
from text files without salting. The ciphertext should be an ASCII file that 
is a sequence of numbers separated by newlines. 
In the submission, please send this assignment text file back by email 
as a text file encrypted using your own RSA public keys. In the email, 
specify the RSA modulus and the RSA secret exponent required to decrypt 
the file. As a bonus, implement one of the faster known algorithms for 
factoring integers. You might have to do a literature research.
